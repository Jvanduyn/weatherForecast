# Weather Forecast App  

## Description

During this project, I wanted to be able to use 3rd party API's in order to have a user check the weather. This web app will allow users to look up the current weather for any city they type out, as well as the 5 day forecast. They will then be able to store whatever city they type in order to look at the weather for that city later.   

- My motivation for this project was to be able to put some of my Javascript skills into on larger scale project. I wanted to be able to make a practical website that someone could use to check the weather. 
- I built this project because I wanted to be able to use API's for a functional website.
- During this project I learned how to be able to impliment 3rd party api's into a functional website and use common Javascript for the user to use a responsive page. 

## Installation

## Credits

During this project, I collaborated with two people I would like to thank. 

First I collaborated with my fellow classmate Alexander. He and I were able to get most of the project working together minus a few issues with the local storage. I would also like to thank a classmate tyler who was able to help me understand how to pull the stored information and display it on the page for the local storage. 

Lastly I was able to work with a tutor of mine Vinnie Lopez. He was able to really help me polish the project off by getting the code working perfectly, and being able to consolidate most of the code to make it functioning properly.

## Features

This project allows a user to find the weather for any city of their choosing. They will be able to see the current weather and weather for the next 5 days. it will then allow them to be able to store their city to local storage to call that city again.
